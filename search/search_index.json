We aim to do this using robust, efficient, and modular embedded systems within exploration devices.</p> <p>The team came about this charter from the EGR314 project description as well as our goals as an embedded systems engineering team. The main theme of our designs is modularity, meaning we are designing embedded systems that have flexible functionality based on how many modules are all working together. We believe this way of designing makes our systems more adaptable and maintainable, and gives us flexibility in the scope of our projects.</p> <p>Below is a table describing each team member's roles and duties.</p> <p>Table 1: Project Roles and Duties</p> Role Duties Assigned Person Meeting Coordinator &amp; Recorder Schedules team meetings, creates and distributes an agenda for each meeting, and runs each meeting.Takes minutes of each team meeting, including attendance, and records action items and to whom they are assigned.

These include Sensors; Movement/Power; Asthetics, User Attention &amp; Human Control; and Communication. We felt like these categories did a good job of encompassing the features of an exploration device. </p> <p>We used the software Lucidchart/Lucidspark as a whiteboard tool to display our brainstormed ideas, because this software is easy to collaborate remotely and has many different formats and tools in which ideas can be displayed.</p> <p> Figure 1 Whiteboard of initial feature brainstorming</p>"},{"location":"02-Concept-Design/Design/#sorting-and-ranking","title":"Sorting and Ranking","text":"<p>Once the general brainstorming of features and ideas was complete. We figured that the 4 broad categories chosen at the start weren't enough to show each part necessary to make a functioning exploration device. To solve this, we divide the 4 categories we had into 7 new ones (Figure 2-8). These are User Interface and Control; Communication Technologies; Detection &amp; Measurement; Navigation &amp; Hazard Avoidance; Movement Mechanics; Power Sources; and Audio &amp; Visual Features. </p> <p>After moving our features into the new categories, we then ranked each feature in terms of high, medium, and low importance. Doing this excersice showed us that most of our new categories made sense for the general device concept we are generating. However, the Power Sources category was not as useful due to the lack of variety in easily accesible mobile power sources. So we will most likely use a battery in the finished product.</p> <p> Figure 2 User Interface &amp; Control   Figure 3 Communication Technologies  Figure 4 Detection &amp; Measurement  Figure 5 Navigation &amp; Hazard Avoidance  Figure 6 Movement Mechanisms  Figure 7 Power Sources  Figure 8 Audio &amp; Visual Features</p>"},{"location":"02-Concept-Design/Design/#concept-generation","title":"Concept Generation","text":"<p>From our features, we generated 3 concepts to choose from for us to develop (Figures 9-11).
