We figured that the 4 broad categories chosen at the start weren't enough to show each part necessary to make a functioning exploration device. To solve this, we divide the 4 categories we had into 7 new ones (Figure 2-8). These are User Interface and Control; Communication Technologies; Detection &amp; Measurement; Navigation &amp; Hazard Avoidance; Movement Mechanics; Power Sources; and Audio &amp; Visual Features. </p> <p>After moving our features into the new categories, we then ranked each feature in terms of high, medium, and low importance. Doing this excersice showed us that most of our new categories made sense for the general device concept we are generating. However, the Power Sources category was not as useful due to the lack of variety in easily accesible mobile power sources. So we will most likely use a battery in the finished product.</p> <p> Figure 2 User Interface &amp; Control   Figure 3 Communication Technologies  Figure 4 Detection &amp; Measurement  Figure 5 Navigation &amp; Hazard Avoidance  Figure 6 Movement Mechanisms  Figure 7 Power Sources  Figure 8 Audio &amp; Visual Features</p>"},{"location":"02-Concept-Design/Design/#concept-generation","title":"Concept Generation","text":"<p>From our features, we generated 3 concepts to choose from for us to develop (Figures 9-11).

It has a front camera and a bright flashlight so we can see clearly in dark water, along with depth and pressure sensors that help track how deep it is and keep it operating safely. Inside the drone, a built in network system connects the sensors and motors using simple communication links. The drone moves using a motor and propeller, with steering fins to help it turn smoothly, and its strong waterproof body makes it useful for research and inspections.</p> <p> Figure 14 Quadcopter Exploration Drone vector sketch</p> <p>The Quadcopter drone will be designed to locate people who are lost in the wilderness.

As a stretch goal, we also intend the device to be capable as a land rover in low atmosphere planets, such as Mars. As a search and rescue robot, it needs to be able to locate survivors by sight, sound, and ground vibrations. </p> <p>The robot must traverse decently rough and granulated terrain in order to be a viable rescue bot, thus 1 and 5 require the device to drive and be stable on this type of terrain.</p> <p>Requirements 2, 3, 4, 9, 15 and 16 are based on the project requirements for this course, due to a certain voltage regulator requirement and communication requirements.</p> <p>For more remote control capability and robot vision, the robot should have a camera that has to stabilize its feed in order to be useful in its intended environment, thus we came up with requirements 6 and 7.</p> <p>Since our device will be in rocky environments, it might find itself upside down; requirement 11 solves this issue by allowing the device to right itself autonomously.</p> <p>Requirements 13, an important part for search and rescue operations,  we want it to quickly recharge the battery in between missions so the drone can resume its activities. Faster charging minimizes time and increases the span of time available to locate and find survivors.</p> <p>Requirement 10 and 14 allows the robot to find survivors who are lost. </p> <p>Requirements 11 and 12 allow the robot to function over a large enough search area to effectively help rescue a survivor.</p> <p>Requirements 8 and 18 allow the robot to communicate with survivors using a microphone and a speaker. The microphone helps detect calls for help and sends it to the operator. The speaker lets rescuers give instructions and guide them to safety. These features make communication possible during search and rescue missions.</p> <p>For the robot to reliably navigate its environment and avoid obstacles, the device must be able to control its speed accurately and turn. Thus requirement 17 addresses this.</p> <p>Requirement 19 allows the robot to detect lower frequency vibrations to detect any movement underneath rubble as well as explosives. </p>"},{"location":"04-Team-Block-Diagram/Team-Diagram/","title":"Block Diagram, Protocol, and Message Structure","text":""},{"location":"04-Team-Block-Diagram/Team-Diagram/#header","title":"Header","text":"<p>Add content!</p>"},{"location":"Appendix/appendix/","title":"Appendix","text":""},{"location":"Appendix/appendix/#appendix-content","title":"Appendix Content","text":"<ul> <li>Appendix - Extra Team Organization Information</li> </ul> <p>add to list.</p>"},{"location":"Appendix/01-Organization-Information/Append-Organization/","title":"Appendix - Extra Team Organization Information","text":""},{"location":"Appendix/01-Organization-Information/Append-Organization/#roles-responsibilities","title":"Roles &amp; Responsibilities","text":"<p>Table 1: Project Roles and Duties</p> Role Duties Meeting Coordinator &amp; Recorder Schedules team meetings, creates and distributes an agenda for each meeting, and runs each meeting.Takes minutes of each team meeting, including attendance, and records action items and to whom they are assigned.
