## Team Charter

> Team 303 is a group of students all of different ages and backgrounds sharing knowledge in order to advance technology in the field of exploration. We aim to do this using robust, efficient, and modular embedded systems within exploration devices.

The team came about this charter from the EGR314 project description as well as our goals as an embedded systems engineering team. The main theme of our designs is modularity, meaning we are designing embedded systems that have flexible functionality based on how many modules are all working together. We believe this way of designing makes our systems more adaptable and maintainable, and gives us flexibility in the scope of our projects.

## Product Mission Statement

 > Our product will revolutionize the design of exploration devices by implementing a modular chain of embedded systems with unique peripherals all communicating and operating in tandem to control an electromechanical exploration device.
