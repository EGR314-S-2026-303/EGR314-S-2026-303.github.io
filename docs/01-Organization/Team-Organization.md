## Team Charter

> Team 303 is a group of students all of different ages and backgrounds sharing knowledge in order to advance technology in the field of exploration. We aim to do this using robust, efficient, and modular embedded systems within exploration devices.

The team came about this charter from the EGR314 project description as well as our goals as an embedded systems engineering team. The main theme of our designs is modularity, meaning we are designing embedded systems that have flexible functionality based on how many modules are all working together. We believe this way of designing makes our systems more adaptable and maintainable, and gives us flexibility in the scope of our projects.

Below is a table describing each team member's roles and duties.

_Table 1: Project Roles and Duties_

| **Role**          | **Duties**                                                                                                                                |**Assigned Person**|
| :---------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |-------------------|
| Meeting Coordinator & Recorder    | Schedules team meetings, creates and distributes an agenda for each meeting, and runs each meeting.Takes minutes of each team meeting, including attendance, and records action items and to whom they are assigned. | Lia Ryan |
| Product Design Lead  | Ensures the physical design of the product is functional and aesthetically pleasing. The lead will ensure the product meets our project requirements and goals.                          | Armando Botiller |
| Project Manager | Coordinates the team's work on a given assignment to Canvas before the due date.                                                          | Vedaa Ubale |
| Project Leader   | Tracks the team's progress relative to the project schedule (Gantt chart) and keeps team members apprised of deadlines and project status | Manuel Castro |
| Subsystem Coordinator   | Decides on subsystem communication protocol and keeps team members aware of any changes to said protocol. Ensures subsystem communication is functional and easy to code. | Khalid Hamdan |
| Website Design Lead   | Ensures the team website is functional and well organized. The lead will ensure the product meets our project requirements and goals. | Matthew Sanderson |

## Product Mission Statement

 > Our product will revolutionize the design of exploration devices by implementing a modular chain of embedded systems with unique peripherals all communicating and operating in tandem to control an electromechanical exploration device.
